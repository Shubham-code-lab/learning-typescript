Automate compile ts file built js file on save  (cons :- only compile one file)
tsc app.ts --watch

//////////////////////////////////////////////////
multiple file compiling
tsc --init

now if we run
tsc    //will compile all typescript file
tsc --watch //will watch all typescript file  //re-execute this command when any changes in tsconfig file


Exclude file 
 "exclude": [
    "exclude-file.ts",
    "node_modules",   //even if we don't mention it get excluded by default
    "*.dev.ts",    // all file with suffix .dev.ts are excluded in same directory
    "**/*.dev.ts" //all file with suffix .dev.ts are excluded in all directory
  ]

Include file
//"include": [],  //work opposite of exclude


javascript version to compile ts file to
 "target": "es2016", 


lib
//if lib is set not set it set some default library/type defination
 "lib": [], //now ts doesn't know about any library i.e :- console, document  //so error
"lib": [   //default included library by typescript

"noEmit": true,   //don't generate .js or compile //useful when we only need syntax highlight  feature of typescript and no output js file

 "downlevelIteration": true,  //in some case compilation gives error due to for loop //turning this feature on will not generate optimize/less/verbose[more code] code but it will compile the ts to js

"noEmitOnError": false     //setting it to false indicate to generate .js file when on compile even there is error exist //setting it true will not allow it
